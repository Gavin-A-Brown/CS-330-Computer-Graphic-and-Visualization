1.	How do I approach designing software?

o	What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?

This project created the opportunity to further refine my understanding of 3D object construction utilizing simple shapes.  Each of the objects chosen is a composite of at least three different shape meshes positioned to overlap or meet at the edges to create a single object, with the exception of the Icosahedron which is a single mesh.

o	What design process did you follow for your project work?

When designing each object, I carefully examined it’s overall form and broke that form down into component shapes: the thermometer for instance is composed of a single cylinder, a flattened toroid and a cone, while the baubles are each composed of two half-spheres with a toroid and flat sphere for the temperature gauge.

o	How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?

Being able to break down complex items into component parts is a core skill of many disciplines.  Practice in this extends from graphics design to art, project management, full stack development and many other areas.

2.	How do I approach developing programs? 

o	What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?

While I do normally follow best-practice guidelines, which is to say iterative development and properly commented code, the abundance of meshes necessary to compose each object in the frame required additional comment segmentation.  I also pushed myself to explore resources available for solutions and look for help with discovered issues more, as I was   unfamiliar with the structure of OpenGL.

o	How did iteration factor into your development?

While developing each object, particularly the smaller ones such as the baubles that required precise placement and shape, I made small adjustments to the meshes I was working with to create the object.  Once this process was done, I would make small adjustments to the placement of each item, comparing it to a photo of the real scene for reference to ensure an accurate facsimile.

o	How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the project’s completion?

I have become significantly more comfortable with the large-scale, repetitive tasks involved in programming, owing to the advice given to manually type out reuseable code from elsewhere in the project.  I have also become more confident in my understanding of development fundamentals and my ability to follow the principles of object-oriented design.  I would say     that my approach has evolved to become more confident and structured, while keeping an open mind to outside solutions.

3.	How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?

o	How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?

Experience working with code, in any programming language, is very translatable to other coursework or certification training.  The attention to detail and iteration required by the nature of visual design also further ingrains these core methodologies for future work and education.  Further, the knowledge of how to break down large structures into smaller chunks is a useful skill, and computational graphics is an excellent reminder of this.  More practically for the field I wish to pursue, knowledge of how to construct 3D scenes is quite useful for the purpose of topography mapping, or virtual environment construction and navigation.
